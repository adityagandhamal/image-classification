## Classification of Fashion-MNIST dataset using both Dense ANNs and CNNs

In this repo, I have created two deeplearning models viz. Dense ANN and CNN using TensorFlow 2.0 for classifying the Fashion-MNIST Dataset.
I have trained both the models using the same Fashion-MNIST data provided by TensorFlow 2.0 and compared the accuracy given by ANN to that of the CNN model.
